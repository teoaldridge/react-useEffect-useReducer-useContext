# react-useEffect-useReducer-useContext
an exercise, in which I learned about the React Hooks useEffect(), useReducer(), and the useContext()API

I did this exercise as part of my studies with React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximillian Schwarzmuller
https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

In this exercise, I learned about, and when and how to use: 
- the useEffect() Hook
- the useReducer() Hook
- the useContext() API

To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.
